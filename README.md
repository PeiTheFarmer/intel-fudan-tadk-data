# intel-fudan-tadk-data
## This is the database specific for intel-fudan collaborate team. 

  Everyone should make their own folder in the root directory. The folder should be named with the initial letter of each word in lower case.
  For instance, the folder of `孟祥帅` should be named with `mxs`. The subfolders of the folder should be named with the name of folder owner and 
  the location. For example, bro Meng collected data in the lab, so he named the subfolder with name `mxs_school`. It is the same at home with name `mxs_home`. It should be noted that for now, we only have device in two places, which is lab and home, the further name of new locations should be discussed in WeChat group. At last, the file should be named with time. For example, bro Meng collected data at 2023_05_04_13_44, then the file name will be 05_04_13_44 with the corresponding suffix. 
  
  Here is a complete folder tree considering the ocassion that bro Meng collected data at 2023_05_04_13_44 in the lab.
